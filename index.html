            Computer software or simply software is any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer's
            processor to perform specific operations. Computer software contrasts with computer hardware, which is the
            physical component of computers. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be
            realistically used without the other. Using a musical analogy, hardware is like a musical instrument and
            software is like the notes played on that instrument.
            Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and their associated documentation. The word
            software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only. Software is
            stored in computer memory and is intangible, i.e. it cannot be touched.
            At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual
            processor – typically a central processing unit (CPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary
            values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For
            example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location inside the computer –
            an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also (indirectly) cause something
            to appear on a display of the computer system – a state change which should be visible to the user. The
            processor carries out the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to
            a different instruction, or interrupted.
            Software written in a machine language is known as "machine code". However, in practice, software is usually
            written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to
            natural language) than machine language. High-level languages are translated, using compilation or
            interpretation or a combination of the two, into machine language. Software may also be written in a
            low-level assembly language, essentially, a vaguely mnemonic representation of a machine language using a
            natural language alphabet. Assembly language is translated into machine code using an assembler.

            A computer program, or just a program, is a sequence of instructions, written to perform a specified task
            with a computer. A computer requires programs to function, typically executing the program's instructions in
            a central processor. The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the
            instructions. The same program in its human-readable source code form, from which executable programs are
            derived (e.g., compiled), enables a programmer to study and develop its algorithms. A collection of computer
            programs and related data is referred to as the software.
            Computer source code is typically written by computer programmers. Source code is written in a programming
            language that usually follows one of two main paradigms: imperative or declarative programming. Source code
            may be converted into an executable file (sometimes called an executable program or a binary) by a compiler
            and later executed by a central processing unit. Alternatively, computer programs may be executed with the
            aid of an interpreter, or may be embedded directly into hardware.
            Computer programs may be ranked along functional lines: system software and application software. Two or
            more computer programs may run simultaneously on one computer from the perspective of the user, this process
            being known as multitasking.
